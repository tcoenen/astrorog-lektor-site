Dear students,

The homework for week 6 is available. It is about exoplanets and you will write a program to re-detect a known exoplanet in Kepler lightcurve data. This data is available from the NASA webpages in FITS format. The assignment will explain you how to perform this analysis.

The reader as of 2017-10-06 is available [here](/assets/week6/astroprog-2017-10-06.pdf).

Sincerely,
Thijs Coenen
